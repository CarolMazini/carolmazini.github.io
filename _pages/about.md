I'm a PhD student associated with the LIGM and LRE laboratories. My research primarily focuses on understanding the reasoning processes of <b>Deep Neural Networks</b>, a field commonly referred to as <b>explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI)</b>. I am particularly interested in the challenge of presenting these complex explanations in a way that is easily interpretable for humans.

I am specially intrigued about the <b>cognitive aspects</b> of machine learning and how it can be compared to human learning.

I earned my master's degree from the <a href='https://ic.unicamp.br/en/'>Institute of Computing (Unicamp)</a>, where my focus was on machine learning applied to image analysis in forensics.

Beyond the computer science domain, I'm also interested in studying language  mechanisms, including <b>semantics</b> and <b>semiotics</b>. I strongly believe they can inspire us to understand even artificial models.
